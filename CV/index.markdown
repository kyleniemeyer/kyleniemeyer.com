Research Interests
==================

My research interests generally include developing tools and strategies to integrate accurate physical models into practical engineering simulations; my current work involves developing chemical mechanism reduction methods and algorithms to use graphics processing units (GPUs) to enable the use of detailed, predictive chemical models in combustion and reactive-flow simulations. More generally, I am also interested in developing strategies to accelerate science and engineering computations with GPUs.
