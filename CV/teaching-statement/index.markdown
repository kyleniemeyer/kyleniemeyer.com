Teaching Statement
==================

My teaching philosophy consists of three primary tenets:

 * Applying fundamental theory and numerical methods to practical problems, emphasizing programming skills,
 * Developing students' critical engineering thinking and problem-solving skills, and
 * Using a science communication methodology to teach complex engineering concepts.

These ideas are based on my experiences thus far as an instructor, combined with my earlier experiences as a student.

Many engineering and applied mathematics courses---particularly introductory courses---lack examples and problems with real-world, practical applications. These types of problems are not only more useful to engineering students as they learn how to apply their theoretical skills, but also help students learn and retain the underlying concepts by connecting them to realistic situations. Such examples also serve to teach useful engineering-thinking and problem-solving skills that are crucial for both industrial careers and graduate research. This means moving beyond rote book problems to more applied, in-depth applications they might experience on the job; problems where the solution procedures are not entirely clear and that require approximations, assumptions, and additional research.

As the instructor of an introductory fluid mechanics course last year, I implemented these strategies by assigning a realistic pipe network design project that built on the more straightforward theoretical homework assignments but required making assumptions and educated judgement calls. Based on the numerous questions and visits I received during office hours, the students initially struggled with a situation where no clear solution existed; however, by the end of the project, nearly all the teams succeeded at creating a reasonable design with the requisite associated analysis. The response from students after the class finished showed the success of my strategy, with comments in my evaluations such as "The term project was very tough but helped cement the ideas from class." In addition, some of my students came to me after after taking the Fundamentals of Engineering exam and said that they felt well prepared for the questions related to fluid dynamics.

I also believe that in order to teach students useful problem-solving skills, courses must emphasize programming through application of the above types of problems. In the real world, both industry and academia, most problems don't have neat analytical solutions but require numerical algorithms to give an answer. Modern engineering relies heavily on simulation and computational modeling, so building strong programming skills---and the understanding of how to apply them---at the undergraduate level is a necessity. In the aforementioned fluid mechanics project, I required students to use computational tools (i.e., programming) in their analysis. In addition, I am developing a numerical methods course that involves significant MATLAB programming where students implement the techniques they learn.

Finally, I also believe in the importance of communicating complex science and engineering ideas to students by reducing the use of jargon and breaking concepts down into more easily understood pieces. Over the period of 2011--2013, I wrote science/engineering articles for the website [Ars Technica](http://www.arstechnica.com), where I explained published research papers to a technically but not scientifically literate audience. Not only did this help improve my writing and communication skills, but through a robust commenting system and typically enthusiastic reader participation in discussions---much like in a classroom or during office hours---it also gave me feedback about my ability to explain complex subjects. This experience contributed significantly to the way I approach teaching and my interactions with students.

In conclusion, my overall teaching philosophy is to prepare students for the real world by giving them practical assignments---building on the fundamental theory---that require them to make engineering judgements and apply critical thinking skills.
